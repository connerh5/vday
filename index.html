		<h4>Let's start out with some quick points.</h4>
		<div class="list">
			<ol>
				<li>You have the most beautiful soul. You're always looking to help someone, and you always have such good intention</li>

				<li>You know exactly when to think about others, including me. I mean that in a very good way. You consider yourself and own feelings, while also heavily considering mine. That's rare.</li>

				<li>Your embrace. You know exactly what I mean. When I'm even just around you, close to you, or anything of the sort, I'm as content as can be.</li>

				<li>Your passion. I'm always blown away by just how much our relationship means to you. What is so attractive about that to me is I feel exactly the same. I've never been so sure that someone loves me, and that I love them just as much</li>

				<li>This one defintely has to be my favorite. You. I know that isn't very creative. But what I mean is all of your traits. Hear me out...</li>
			</ol>

		<div class="p2">
			<p> That last listing is wayyyyy to vague, and I can not sum that up in a list. I'll never be able to sum up how much I love you for you. You're always looking out for me. Whenever I'm there lost, or making a silly decision (like buying another car) you're <i>right there</i>, guiding me through it. You always know what to say to me when I'm feeling down or stressed. And you always know how to make me happier when I'm already just fine. You always listen when I'm going on and on about my day or my passions. You make sure that I know that you care and that you're listening too.<br><br> You care, you listen, and most of all, you love. Whenever I'm there in the dark, you are <strong>always</strong> there for me. I always thought that last year would be the worst year of my life. That still holds true. But you were also able to make it the best year of my life. I cried and wept, but thanks to you, I was able to love. You <strong>saved</strong> me, and I will never to be able to thank you enough for that. So instead, I'll just love you for it. 
			<br><br> 
			I love you vigorously Brittney, Happy Valentines Day.</p>
